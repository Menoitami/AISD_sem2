# AISD Semester 2: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This repository contains solutions and comparative analyses for various data structures and algorithms implemented in C++. The focus is on performance evaluation and algorithmic efficiency.

## Labs

### Lab 1: Tree Structures Comparison

This lab implements and compares the efficiency of different types of trees:

1. **Red-Black Tree**
2. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
3. **AVL Tree**

The lab includes implementations of insertion, deletion, and search operations for each tree type, and provides performance metrics for comparison.

### Lab 2: Shortest Path Algorithms

This lab focuses on comparing the performance of different shortest path algorithms using various heap data structures:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Standard Implementation)**
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm with Fibonacci Heap**
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm with Binary Heap**

The lab evaluates the algorithms based on execution time for graphs with varying densities and sizes.

### Lab 3: Compression Algorithms

This lab explores various data compression algorithms:

1. **Huffman Coding (HA)**
2. **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**
3. **Lempel-Ziv 78 (LZ78)**
4. **Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT)**
5. **Move-To-Front (MTF)**
6. **Arithmetic Coding (AC)**
7. **Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM)**

The lab includes implementations and performance evaluations of these algorithms.

## Coursework
